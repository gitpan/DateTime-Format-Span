=head1 NAME

DateTime::Format::Span - Get a locale specific string describing the span of a given duration

=head1 VERSION

This document describes DateTime::Format::Span version 0.0.1

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use DateTime;
    use DateTime::Format::Span

    my $span = DateTime::Format::Span->new();
    my $dur = $dta - $dtb;
    print $span->format_duration($dur); # 1 year, 2 months, 3 minutes, and 1 second
  
    print $span->format_duration_between($dta, $dtb); # 1 year, 2 months, 3 minutes, and 1 second

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Get a localized string representing the duration.

For example:

    1 second
    2 minutes and 3 seconds
    3 weeks, 1 day, and 5 seconds
    4 years, 1 month, 2 days, 6 minutes, 1 second, and 345000028 nanoseconds

=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 new()

Create span object, no args

=head2 format_duration()

First argument is a DateTime::Duration object

After that you can optionally pass some 'standard args' as a hash as described below

=head2 format_duration_between()

First two args are DateTime objects

After that you can optionally pass some 'standard args' as a hash as described below

=head2 standard args

=over 4

=item 1 'locale' 

locale of the $dt object will be used if you do not specify this

Valid values are a string of the locale (E.g 'fr'), a DateTime object, or a DateTime object's 'locale' key.

=item 2 since we're working with 2 datetime objects of known points we can have past and future tenses.

=over 4

=item * past

String to use if duration is past tense. Can have a sprintf '%s' or else is prepended with a trailing space.

=item * future

String to use if duration is future tense. Can have a sprintf '%s' or else is prepended with a trailing space.

=item * no_time 

Override the 'no_time' in the locale hash.

=back

If duration is baseless (IE ambiguouse) then 'past' and 'future' is used based on if $dur->in_units has negatives or not.

Also by nature it's not split into type groups:

An example is

  DateTime::Duration->new('seconds'=> 62)
  
Will result in '62 seconds' not '1 minute and 2 seconds'

For more sane results always be specific by using 2 datetime object to get a duration object

=back

    print $dt->format_duration_between(
        $dta,
        $dtb, 
        'past'   => 'Your account expired %s ago.', 
        'future' => 'Your account expires in %s.', 
        'no_time'=> 'Your account just expired.',
    );

This facilitates, for example, this L<Locale::Maketext> vernacular which becomes:

   'Your account [duration,_1,_2,expired %s ago,expires in,just expired].' => '[Votre compte [duration,_1,_2,a expirÃ© il ya,expire dans,vient d'expirer].'

=head1 LOCALIZATION

Localization is provided by the included DateTime::Format::Span::Locale modules.

Included are DateTime::Format::Span::Locale::es, DateTime::Format::Span::Locale::fr, DateTime::Format::Span::Locale::pt

More will be included as time permits/folks volunteer :)

They are setup this way:

DateTime::Format::Span::Locale::XYZ where 'XYZ' is the ISO code of DateTime::Locale

It can have one of 2 functions used in this order:

=over 4

=item get_human_span_from_units_array()

Try to use get_human_span_hashref() if the locale is disposed to it since its much easier... That said:

Takes the arguments as described in the example below, should return the localized "span" string.

    sub get_human_span_from_units_array {
        my ($years, $months, $weeks, $days, $hours, $minutes, $seconds, $nanoseconds, $args_hr) = @_; # note: has no negative numbers
        ...
        return $string; # 1 year, 2days, 4 hours, and 17 minutes
    }

=item get_human_span_hashref()

Takes no arguments, should return a hashref of this structure:

    sub get_human_span_hashref {
        return {
            'no_oxford_comma' => 1,
            'no_time' => 'pas le temps',
            'and'     => 'et',    
            'year'  => 'an',
            'years' => 'ans',
            'month'  => 'mois',
            'months' => 'mois',
            'week'  => 'semaine',
            'weeks' => 'semaines',
            'day'  => 'jour',
            'days' => 'jours',
            'hour'  => 'heure',
            'hours' => 'heures',
            'minute'  => 'minute',
            'minutes' => 'minutes',
            'second'  => 'seconde',
            'seconds' => 'seconds',
            'nanosecond'  => 'nanoseconde',
            'nanoseconds' => 'nanosecondes',      
        };
    }

=head1 LOCALIZATION of DateTime::Format modules

L<DateTime> does an excellent job at implementing localization. Often L<DateTime::Format> based class's either don't support localization or they implement it haphazardly and inconsistently.

With this module I hope to model a localization scheme that is inline with L<DateTime> and is consistent and reuseable between <DateTime::Format> based classes.

The idea is to determine the locale to use based on a DateTime object.

XYZ::Locale should handle looking up (ans caching if appropriate) the locale and loading the necessary locale module XYZ::Locale::fr

The specific locale module holds the data and possibly logic neccesary to do what XYZ does in the vernacular of the given locale.

=head2 TODO 

Eventually the generic logic will be re-broken out into its own module for re-use by your class and I'll have more detailed POD about how to do it.

In the meantime if you're interested pleaes contact me and I'd be happy to help and/or expediate this TODO.
